# myPizzaShop
Pizza shop management system

this is a simple project that demonstrates some of my basic OOP knowledge. 

the App takes and processes pizza orders using a GUI built via JavaFX.
the orders are taken, the price is calculated based on user input and then the orders are sorted and printed on the screen.
